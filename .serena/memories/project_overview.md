# Applio Project Overview

## Purpose
Applio is a high-quality voice conversion tool built on Retrieval-Based Voice Conversion (RVC) technology. It provides both a Gradio-based web interface and CLI for training voice models and performing voice conversion with various audio processing features.

## Fork-Specific Information
This is a personal fork with the following customizations (most code generated by ClaudeCode):
- Python 3.13 + PyTorch 2.8 support
- Added mangio-crepe pitch adjustment algorithm (implementation may differ from upstream)
- Realtime tab enhancements:
  - Template system for saving device connections, model settings, and parameters
  - WDM-KS audio API support (enables WASAPI-WDM-KS mixed API usage)
  - Extended F0 methods: crepe-tiny/small/medium/full, mangio-crepe-tiny/full, hybrid combinations

## Key Features
- Voice conversion using RVC (Retrieval-Based Voice Conversion)
- Multiple F0 (pitch) extraction methods: RMVPE, FCPE, CREPE, SWIFT, hybrid modes
- Various embedder models: ContentVec, SPIN, Hubert variants (language-specific)
- Real-time voice conversion with low-latency optimizations
- TTS (Text-to-Speech) with voice conversion
- Model training with overtraining detection
- Post-processing effects: reverb, pitch shift, compression, noise reduction, etc.
- Plugin system for extensibility
- Multi-language support (i18n)
