# About this Fork
This is a fork that reflects my personal preferences and customizations.
**Note:** Most of the code added to this repository was generated by ClaudeCode. As a result, I may not be able to answer technical questions or provide in-depth explanations about the implementation details.

## 追加機能
※ ここで実装しているmangio-crepeはノイズ処理などの部分で多少本家実装とは異なる｡
### トレーニングタブ
- ピッチ調整アルゴリズムにmangio-crepeを追加  

### リアルタイムタブ
- テンプレート機能を追加､接続デバイスや設定モデル､各種Valueなどを保存可能
- WDM-KSを設定可能に､これはWASAPI-WDM-KSなどの異なったAPI間でも使用可能
- f0推定アルゴリズムにcrepe-tiny/small/midium/full及びmangio-crepe-tiny,full及びhybridを追加(rmvpe+crepe/rmvpe+mangio-crepe/crepe+mangio-crepe)､hybridは適用量を設定可能
※ small,midium,largeは自身でonnxモデルを追加必要ありであんまりパフォーマンスも良くないので削除するかも｡

> [!NOTE]  
> Applio will no longer receive frequent updates. Going forward, development will focus mainly on security patches, dependency updates, and occasional feature improvements. This is because the project is already stable and mature with limited room for further improvements. Pull requests are still welcome and will be reviewed.
